# JAMSite

---

Built with Hugo and the Tale theme. 

This is take 2 because the course behind it is terse and it got ruined so badly (since I don't know how to really use git and I could not successfully revert breaking changes) that it will be easier to rebuild the site all over again. This will also be more practice to etch Hugo and JAMStack concepts into my stoned-ass brain. Fucking annoying. Anyway, here goes.
